# Lil' Proppy 

I want to build into a gallery app a quick way to explore a control's properties and see the impact of changes. It turns out this is something that was added recently to the Xamarin.Forms Control Gallery used to running UI tests.

In this repo I will iterate on this UI in isolation from the larger project where I want to eventually use it.
